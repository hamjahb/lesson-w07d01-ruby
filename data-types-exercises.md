### Assorted Data Types

#### What are the outputs and/or side effects of the following code snippets?

* Make a guess before testing your answer.
* "Error out" is a valid answer choice.
* Also include a sentence on why you chose your answer.

```rb
2 ** 3
```
```text
8
```

```rb
((16 / 4) * (2 + 1)) ** 2
```
```text
144
```

```rb
("a milli " + "a milli") * 3
```
```text
"a milli a millia milli a millia milli a milli"
```

```rb
("a milli " * 4) / 2
```
```text
NoMethodError: undefined method `/' for "a milli a milli a milli a milli ":String
```

```rb
my_favorite_number = 13
puts "My favorite number is: " + my_favorite_number
```
```text
TypeError: no implicit conversion of Integer into String
```

```rb
my_favorite_number = 13
puts "My favorite number is: #{my_favorite_number}"
```
```text
My favorite number is: 13
```

### Truthiness and Falsiness

#### Which of these evaluate as `false` in Ruby? Mark all that apply.

```text
[x] false
[ ] 0
[ ] ""
[ ] null
[ ] [ ] (empty array)
[ ] undefined
[ ] NaN
[x] nil
```

#### What are the outputs and/or side effects of the following code snippets?

### Conditionals

Write the code for the following exercise inside of the `app.rb` located in this repo. Run/test your code using `ruby app.rb` in the Terminal.

#### Write FizzBuzz in Ruby!

Fizz-Buzz is a classic coding exercise that you can create using your knowledge of conditionals and loops. Implement code that does the following...

* Counts from 1 to 100 and prints out something for each number.
* If the number is divisible by 3, print `"Fizz"`.
* If the number is divisible by 5, print `"Buzz"`.
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
* If the number does not meet any of the above conditions, just print the number.

Your output should look something like this...
```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...
```

  <summary><strong>We haven't covered loops yet, so to get you started...</strong></summary>

  ```rb
 i = 1
while i <= 100
  # Your code goes in here.
  if i % 5 == 0 && i % 3 == 0
    puts 'Fizz Buzz'
    i += 1
  elsif  i % 5 == 0
    puts 'buzz'
    i += 1
  elsif i % 3 == 0
    puts 'fizz' 
    i += 1
  else 
    puts i
    i += 1
  end
end
  ```
